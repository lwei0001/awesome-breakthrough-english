In fact, this issue is not cloud issue. Due to network or other issue, uploading action may be a long time work. If there is time out error when uploading file (not only attach to cloud), the issue will occur. (peridot-11336)
 
Attachments can only be saved to folders, not files. So the files are not displayed when clicking 'save to cloud'.Thanks. (peridot-11294)
 
hi Devendra Pudke,
In code, it checks string ("Re") at the beginning of subject and the string checking is not case sensitive. So the issue occurs. I think changing the default 'Re' to 're' or 'RE' manually by user is an edge case. Client can modify the checking case sensitive to fix this edge case, but it can still happen if user change 'Re' to other words (such as 'reply' etc.). Thanks. (support-3665)
