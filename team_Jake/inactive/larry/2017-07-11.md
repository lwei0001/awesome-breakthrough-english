Hi, Rohit

I have two questions about cloud, and maybe you can help me . Thanks a lot.

Q1:

I replace webtop-personal-cloud-1.0.2.jar with webtop-personal-cloud-1.0.1.jar and restart tomcat. But it restarts unsuccessfully. Attachment is the webtop log.  Could you have a look and let me know the reason? Thanks.

Q2:

About storage.authentication.associate API, if ‘redirectUri’ is ‘http://localhost:8080/kiwi/index-rui-dev.jsp#app/settings’, webtop will return an error. Please refer to attachment error.png. But if ‘redirectUri’ is ‘http://localhost:8080/kiwi/index-rui-dev.jspapp/settings’ (removed ‘#app/settings’), the cloud can be associated successfully. I think the ‘#’ could be the reason that webtop complains. Could you help to take a look into this?  Thanks.

Thanks,
Larry
