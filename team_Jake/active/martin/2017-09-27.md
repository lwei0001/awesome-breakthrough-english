Hi Jennifer,
 
There was a problem when I was trying to sign up for the ADP Workforce. 
When I finished the requested info, I can not click "Confirm" Button like it was disabled, this happened on both Chrome and
Safari browser.
Is this a compatibility problem or something else went wrong?

Regards,
Martin

Comments for Jira Story:  
1. Implemented the title text changing requirement, the current text format is "FolderName(unread count) AccountName Tesla for 
kiwi", you also could change the format as you wish.
2. This story dose not need QA test for this moment. So i just close it.  
3. Customized the background style of ToolBar which shows when the mouse hover the folder item.
