# Original

It's technically possible to implement the improvement in RichUI.
Need about 1 day to display folder name like Gmail in Preview None & Preview Below mode. 
But in Preview Right mode it's difficult to find a place to show folder name. 
If put it beside subject, the space for subject and from will be very small. 
If put it right bottom corner, there is other 4 icons, attachment icon ,flag icon, conversation number (configurable) and mail size(configurable). 
Need a UI design in Preview Right mode.

# Refactored
It's doable to implement this improvement in RichUI.
One day work for displaying folder name in Preview None and Preview Below modes(same as Gmail does).
But for the Preview Right mode, I'm afraied we need to make an design decision first about where to put the folder name:
1. Put it besides the subject, the room for subject and from feilds could be too small. 
2. Put it at bottom right corner, there are already other 4 icons need to display: attachment, flag, convresation message number(configurable) and mail size(configurable).
