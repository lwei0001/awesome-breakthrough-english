Fixed in PERIDOT-8644 and as I commented there:

I think this is not a regression, it is reproduced on Tablet.

It was only fixed on Phone in PERIDOT-5248 of which the status is still resolved, and no QA retested it.

Meiwen Hwang what do you mean about 'it seems to be broken'?

The message list uses infinite scroll technology.

It doesn't cache Dom element in TUI.

It maybe just create about 28 message elements. The number of message elements won't increase by scrolling down.

For better user experience, it only caches the message data from server.

It does not have serious performance problem even if there are 10 thousands messages whose total size is less than 10 M .
