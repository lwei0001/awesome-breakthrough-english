Hi Rohit,
 
Please excuse me for bothering you. I found an issue when I was using the Cloud API.
 
Issue: The data structure returned by 'storage.file.create' API is not consistent with the structure returned by 'storage.folder.list'.
 
The data structure returned by 'storage.file.create' is like the following
 
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : "",
  "result" : {
    "@type" : "file",
    "id" : "/auto-upload/oklcpe-1jyw.jpg",
    "name" : "oklcpe-1jyw.jpg",
    "size" : 3064635,
    "contentType" : null
  },
  "procTime" : 1871
}
 
and the structure returned by 'storage.folder.list' is like 
 
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : "",
  "result" : [
    ...
    {
    "@type" : "file",
    "id" : "/auto-upload/oklcpe-1jyw.jpg",
    "name" : "oklcpe-1jyw.jpg",
    "size" : 3064635,
    "contentType" : "image/jpeg",
    "thumbnail" : {
      "accountId" : "2bf9e1fc-ce0c-4fb3-b27d-d0fbb2314aa0",
      "fileId" : "AFqxUjip9d3UfzKzX2gxmrUSajt_43bdDPWerAXSFGQPNwC_hHGMWgrv5Bmuz7GRPOWrwBBUSSfOsaEbUYEdhXo~:oklcpe-1jyw.jpg",
      "type" : "thumbnail"
    }
  }, 
  ...
  ],
  "procTime" : 712
}
 
The property 'contentType' is null and there is no 'thumbnail' property in the data structure returned by 'storage.file.create' by comparing the two structures.
 
Could the two data structures be consistent?


Hi Dean,
 
Just wondering on how the UI is impacted with the response from those APIâ€™s. Looking at Etisalat client the response for folder list has the thumbnail property while the response for file create does not have that property.
And also on the content type which is null that seems to me an issue, would the UI consume that property?
 
Thanks,
Rohit


Hi Rohit,

Thanks for your reply.

The purpose of keeping same structure is that client would reduce the request to Wetop. If the response includes content type and thumbnail, client would cache the result and it would not send 

request when opening Cloud file manager.

Now it sends request to get cloud information  every time when opening Cloud file manager in 2.3. I want to reduce the request.
