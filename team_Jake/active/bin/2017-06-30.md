Hi Shaun,

This issue needs the "preview" field from Webtop XML API "msgheaderfetch" on client. RUI and TUI is using Webtop XML API ("msgheaderlist", "msgheaderfetch" and "msgfetch") for mail services, and the current implementation doesn't not really allow an easy decoupling of UI and the xml data format. Our rough estimation for switching to JSON API would be more than 2 weeks with high risks. Given this situation, can you please consider to add xml api for this?

Thanks
Bin.
