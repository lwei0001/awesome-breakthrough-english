Hi, Takuya Shimura,  
1. The "contacts.updateContact" is a Webtop server API that is called by client to save constact in step 10 of your test.  
2. The "contacts.getContacts" Webtop server API is irrelevant to this issue.  
3. The contact folder is "Auto-Complete" in step 4, the value of "addressBookId" is defined by default as "autoComplete". which is differ from other "addressBookId" that is created as Number type in server.  
4. This issue has been fixed in PERIDOT-9095. To fix this issue, I called "loadAddressBookAndContacts" method to load "Main addressBook" after App switches to "Contact" in step 8, which changed "addressBookId" from "autoComplete" to "Main addressBookId" to prevent a incorrect addressBookId argument is passed to "contacts.updateContact" API.  
Thanks,
Bin

Hi, Takuya Shimura.  
This issue is caused by the incorrect value of "addressBookId" in "contacts.updateContact" request. 
What does "a lazy update of addressBookId" mean here?

...

1. "contacts.updateContact" is a Webtop API used for updating contact information after changes
3. The "Auto-Complete" folder(addressbook) mentioned in step 4, has a speciel "addressBookId" which the value is "autoComplete" by default and looks very different to normal "addressBookId" as Number.
4. This issue is fixed in PERIDOT-9095. To fix it, client needs to call "loadAddressBookAndContacts" method to load "Main addressBook" after switches to "Contact" app in step 8. And it will change "addressBookId" from "autoComplete" to correct "Main addressBookId" to avoid an incorrect "addressBookId" passed to "contacts.updateContact" API call.
