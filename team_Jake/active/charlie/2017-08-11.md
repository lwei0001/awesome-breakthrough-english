Hi, Shreenivas

There are two UI changes in the message list that need to discuss with you:

1, Add message preview info in the message list (refer to preview_message.png). This is a new feature (refer to PERIDOT-11099 ).

2, Add folder name on search massage list (refer to folder_name.png). According to the requirements, after search messages, there should show folder name in the message search list.

From the designer perspective, what do you think about these UI changes? Or any suggestions?
