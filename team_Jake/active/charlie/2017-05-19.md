Hi Shimura-san
I reproduced this issue.
About the message body text, we only support to drag an attachment file to the message body. If user drags something(not file), will case this issue. i.e. user selects a text, drag the text to the message body, we think user wants to upload an attachment, during the uploading time, set the toolbar to disabled and after uploaded will set the toolbar to enable . Because the selected text not a file, can not upload successful, so the toolbar can not be set to enable. That' why user can not click 'Send', 'Save' or 'Cancel' button.
