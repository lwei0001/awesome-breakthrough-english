Hi, Deirdre Clancy,

Thanks for your work.
I have reviewed your changes in the document, there is an issue:

This key is ui.rui.calendar.listToolbar, not `ui.rui.calendar.calendarContainer.listToolbar`. Your need add a new key in the document, thanks.

Hi Deirdre Clancy,

You are right, this key should be created in the document. And I have reviewed the change in the document, thanks a lot for the work.
However, the value of this key has been changed to `3` recently. The value should be updated, so I reopened this ticket.

Yes, this is a Rich UI setting. But we named it `mail.enableDetachedPreview`.
