Hi Rohit,

I have some questions about cloud to confirm with you.

Q1:

In Etisalat, if user uploads a file with size exceeded a certain value ( for example 5M ), the file will be uploaded to cloud and display as a link. Is this a feature supported by current cloud server?

Q2:

What is the max size of single file attached ? Is it limited?

Q3:

After removing count account and adding another again, it will not jump to personal cloud login page, but associate with the previous personal account automatically. QA thinks it may be unreasonable. Could you explain it?

Thanks,
Larry
