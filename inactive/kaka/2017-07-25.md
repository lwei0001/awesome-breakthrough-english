There are bad news and good news.

The bad news is that there is no cross-version solution. This feature is only natively supported by IE9+.

We can implement this feature by JavaScript code, but the efficiency is too low cause we must listen every input from the user.

The good news is that this feature can be disabled on IE.

If we want to keep consistency across browsers, consider closing this feature on IE by adding "document.execCommand("AutoUrlDetect", false, false);" to your code.
