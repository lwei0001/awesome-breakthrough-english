HI, Luis and Mark

About MR1 regression and ticket: 
1.	Because Fastweb use RH7 platform, QA didn’t have this environment ; we need kick a fresh install regression run on CFGDB mode;  
There is an RH7 environment  devioniq.es.cpth.ie, the nightly is running RG-58-RH7-CfgDB on razorgate-5.8.043-8.ge7d5696.x86_64.rpm build ; whether can  we kick a RG5.8.043 regression run on this server? And we don’t need to setup a new RH7 machine
2.	Ticket RAZORGATE-2667 Logging cid in SmtpClientClose  didn’t merged into RG5.8.043, need to remove from Release Note,
3.	From dashboard https://jira.synchronoss.net:8443/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=20458, there is a ticket RAZORGATE-2657:Registry settings in config.db should be not case sensitive;  status is open in MR1 label, would update the Label to MR2?
4.	cptest@good.es.cpth.ie , seems this server ipv6 unavailable ,so some script like qa/Messaging/RazorGate/policies/comparisons/abuse_test/rbl/ipv6/ Fail
    [cptest@good bin]$  tracepath6  devcrown0008.es.cpth.ie
    connect: Network is unreachable
    [cptest@good bin]$
    [cptest@good bin]$ tracepath6 "fd00::105:0:0:31:8"
    connect: Network is unreachable

    I don’t have root right to do more on this server, if possible please help 
Thanks
