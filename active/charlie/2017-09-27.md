Hi Deirdre,

I have reviewed the changes in the document. Thanks a lot.

There is not suitable section to put these config keys in the document. You should create a new section for these changes, for example, a sub-topic of 'Configuration Keys' called 'Cloud Setting'. And the description of the section: The properties define under cloud contain cloud settings for Rich UI and Touch UI.

Hi Deirdre,

The API information has nothing to do with the current ticket, only need to attention to the config changes. 
And the `mail.defaultSortOrder` has been updated correctly, so I close this ticket.

Thanks,
Charlie
