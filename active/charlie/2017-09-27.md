Hi Deirdre,

I have reviewed the changes in the document. Thanks a lot.

There is no suitable section to put these config keys in the document. Maybe you need to create a new section for these changes. For example, a sub-item of 'Configuration Keys' named 'Cloud Setting'. And the description of the section is "The properties defined under cloud include cloud settings for both Rich UI and Touch UI".

Hi Deirdre,

The API information has nothing to do with the current ticket. And we only need to pay attention to the config changes. 
And the `mail.defaultSortOrder` has been updated correctly, so I've closed this ticket.

Thanks,
Charlie
