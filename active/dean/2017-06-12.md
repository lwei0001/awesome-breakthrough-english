Hi Matthieu,

There are two tickets need you to confirm (PERIDOT-7379 and PERIDOT-7998).

1, PERIDOT-7379 is about the navigation(previous/next month) of event list view in Calendar.
In order to be consistent with month/week/day view mode, I think the behavior should be:
swiping left to show event list in next month, swiping right to show event list in previous month. 
What do you think?

2,  PERIDOT-7998 is about auto-scrolling to event list of the date user tapped in month/week view. 
There are many comments in SERVICES-3728, but no final decision in so far. 
I just finish the implementation of auto-scrolling to event list of the date user tapped. 
Could you please check it and let me know if there is any other features need to do?

I've checked in the code for both tickets, you can visit http://rwc-hinoki06:8080/kiwi-master/index-tui.jsp#app/calendar to take a look.

Thank you.
