Need to confirm if the feature is like phone section in which multiple home phone number can be added.

If so, I think Webtop needs to do some work about data structure.

An address contains street, city, state, zip and country information.

The current format of request to create contact is as following:

contacts.createContact {
	"contact" : {
		...
		"fields" : [
                              ...
                              {
				"value" : "home_street",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "street"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_city",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "city"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_state",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "state"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_zip",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "zip"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_country",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "country"
			}
		]
	}
}

Every data node is independent about address structure above.

Type, such as 'lzAddress_home', determines whether the node is home address or work address. 

If we support multiple home address, it is impossible to assemble the correct address as we can hardly find any unique correspondence among these data.

For example: 

Add two home addresses.

In the first home address, set 'home_street1, home_city1, home_state1, home_zip1, home_country1' to relevant input.

In the second home address, set 'home_street2, home_city2, home_state2, home_zip2, home_country2' to relevant input.

The format of request will be as following:

contacts.createContact {
	"contact" : {
		"@type" : "Contact",
		...
		"fields" : [
                              ...
                              {
				"value" : "home_street1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "street"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_street2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "street"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_city1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "city"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_city2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "city"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_state1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "state"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_state2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "state"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_zip1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "zip"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_zip2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "zip"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_country1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "country"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_country2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "country"
			}
		]
	}
}

There are two countries above.

One is 'home_country1' and the other is 'home_country2'.

But the types in these two countries are both 'lzAddress_home', and that's indistinguishable.

So if we planned to support multiple home address or work address, Webtop must change.
