There is a 'globalMaskDelay' key in client-config.

The key is to reduce the frequency of occurrence of the mask.

If it is set to 0, the loading spinner will appear immediately when switching to another month.

If the CPU is busy, the behavior will be affected.

Please set 'globalMaskDelay' to 0, then check whether there is a spinner or not.

The two keys and the relevant codes were added at 30th Sept 2015. The commit is
