After talking with Jary, I thought that the reason why the first emoji "â˜º" cannot be displayed on TUI is that the emoji coding is not supported and it could be caused by system upgrade of mobile devices. 

There is really nothing much we can do but removing that emoji character from our library, so I suggest placing it in an inconspicuous position or just ignoring it.

This issue is caused by the lack of "richText" field in the response of "mail.attachmentView.search", on which client depends to choose plain or rich format. Now "reply"/"reply all" is using default format (plain) under Attachment view. 

Could Webtop add "richText" field for "mail.attachmentView.search" or give some suggestions to make mail formats distinguishable?
