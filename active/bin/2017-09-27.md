From my tests on "rwc-hinoki06.owmessaging.com:8080/kiwi-uxdevelop-release/" with "francis/p", I found that request for mail detail was also based on "richText" field from "mail.attachmentView.search" response. See the parameter __html="text"__ of mail detail request as follow: (it's from "richText" field in client).
So client cannot get formats from mail detail. Could you please add "richText" field for "mail.attachmentView.search"?

Because to fix this issue would have an impact to Webtop performance, and there are no functional defects about it. I suggest to downgrade it to S4, and client would use the same format (rich or plain) in Attachment view.
