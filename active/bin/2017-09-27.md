From my tests on "rwc-hinoki06.owmessaging.com:8080/kiwi-uxdevelop-release/" with "francis/p", I found that request for mail detail was also based on "richText" field from "mail.attachmentView.search", see the parameter __html="text"__ of mail detail request as follow: (it's from "richText" field in client).
So client cannot get formats from mail detail. Could you please add "richText" field for "mail.attachmentView.search"?

Between this issue would have an impact on Webtop performance, and there will not be functional defects about it. Therefore I suggest downgrading that to S4, and client would use the same format (rich or plain) under Attachment view.
