Hi,

Considering the width of the mobile device, when user slides the message to the left in the mail list, the interface should be allowed to deal with email in a more convenient and efficient way. So we only provide a quick list (not including 'reply all') on the mail list. And detailed list (including 'reply all') was provided in the mail detail. So this is actually working as expected.

Thanks

Shirley.

The mobile number of 'Keron' is '(17) 234/789 - 09', it contains 3 spaces, and those spaces lead to the wrong search result in Webtop.

My manager and I thought that we should keep the format with the initial mail when we do 'reply' or 'reply all'. But, when we do 'forward' (including 'forward as attachment' and 'forward as inline message'), we should use the default format. And my solution is based on this viewpoint.
