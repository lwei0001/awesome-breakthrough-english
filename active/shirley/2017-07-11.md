Hi Rohit,

Is the feature 'whitelist' in your task list?  Simply add the feature :

XXXXXXX

I have some questions about it: 

Does the 'Whitelist sender' require a new API? If not, which one can be used in the existing APIs?

Thanks & Regards,

Shirley

Switching from main account to external account, 'Conversion view' will be disabled but this option will not be saved. If user wants to show the mail list with 'Conversion view' in external account, he/she has to choose again. There are two reasons for this behavior :

1. External account doesn't support 'Conversion view'.

2. Consistent with 'Attachment view'.

So this is actually working as expected.

The 'Recurring Daily event' is actually a series of events. Selecting one in this series and changing into Repeat-Never, then update 'All events in the series' (operating the whole events sequence), all the event will be deleted except '10th' (mentioned in the description). Tested on Gmail and outlook and got the same result. So this is actually working as expected.
