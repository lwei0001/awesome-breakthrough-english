Hi Rohit,

After reading the HLD of the "Whitelisting", I have 3 questions about the detail.

Q: Should I Add 2 configuration settings? And What are the differences between them? 

Q: What are the corresponding keys of these two configurations value in server? Which one should I use to access those keys? 'mailPreference' or 'generalPreference'?

Q: When user clicks 'Whitelist sender', add the sender in 'Whitelist PAB' or safe sender list?

Thanks & Regards,
Shirley

Added a configuration setting for 'Whitelisting'. When it is 'enable', there will be another setting used in the safe sender tab.
Only the messages from users in 'Whitelist PAB' will show up in the inbox while other messages go to the spam folder.

Added three options 'Whitelist sender', 'Block domain' and 'Block sender and mark as spam' in the drop down menu. Reordered the list, grouped all the options and separated them with two separators.
