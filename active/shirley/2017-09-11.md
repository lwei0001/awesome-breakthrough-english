Hi Rohit,

Thanks for your clearly explanationÔºÅI have 2 questions about details:
1. Does the checkbox 'Enable Whitelisting' which I added before need to be removed?
2. The display of the font-end page is based on some configurations, can you list them in detail? 
For example, you have mentioned 'The above 6 options should only be shown when running against PAB - Mx env(Octane)' in description,
which configuration controls the display of those 6 options?

Thanks & Regards,
Shirley


Hi Rohit,

When user selects "contacts only" option, you said 'the allowed sender address list should be disabled on UI' because 'User is provided the option to ONLY allow their contacts to send email to them.  
If that's the case, we don't want to allow the user to add/remove any entries except when they add/remove contacts' (Mark said).
So what about block sender address list? Should it be disabled too?
And when user receives a mail from his/her contacts, can he/she block this sender? 
According to the strong connection between 'Safe sender' and 'Block sender', I need a thorough understanding.

Thanks & Regards,
Shirley
