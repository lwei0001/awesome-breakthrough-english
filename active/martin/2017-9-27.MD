Hi Jennifer,
 
There is a problem when i registed the ADP Workforce. 
When i finished the requested info, i can not click "Confirm" Button like it is disabled, this happened on both chrome and
safari browser.
So i want to know is this website only for IE browser or there is other reason for this problem?

Regards,
Martin

1.Implementing the title text changing requirement, the current text format is "FolderName(Unreadcount) AccountName Tesla for 
kiwi", you also could change the format as you need.
2.This story dose not need QA test this moment.So i just close it.  
3.Custom the background style of ToolBar which shows when the mouse hover the folder item.
