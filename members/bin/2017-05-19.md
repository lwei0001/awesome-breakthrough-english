Hi, Takuya Shimura.

Hi, Takuya Shimura,  
1. The "contacts.updateContact" is a Webtop server API that is called by client to save constact in step 10 of your test.  
2. The "contacts.getContacts" Webtop server API is irrelevant to this issue.  
3. The contact folder is "Auto-Complete" in step 4, the value of "addressBookId" is defined by default as "autoComplete". which is differ from other "addressBookId" that is created as Number type in server.  
4. This issue has been fixed in PERIDOT-9095. To fix this issue, I called "loadAddressBookAndContacts" method to load "Main addressBook" after App switches to "Contact" in step 8, which changed "addressBookId" from "autoComplete" to "Main addressBookId" to prevent a incorrect addressBookId argument is passed to "contacts.updateContact" API.  
Thanks,
Bin
