1. After some investigation, I found the cause of this issue is the values of *received-date* and *sent-date** are inconsistent: we are using *received-date* as date value when click "Inbox" folder, and using the other when click "Send" folder, they are both from "msgheaderlist" Webtop API. I suggest talking with Webtop developer, and reach an agreement to choose one for it.

1. There seems some misundersanding about what is *received-date* and *sent-date*:
*received-date* is actually the time when a email sent from out side reach to our mail server. It's not the time when user click "inbox" to list the message.
*sent-date* is the time when a email is really sent from mail server. It's not the time user click "Send".

2. Hi Chetan Kandhare,  
The tests you gave are based on original design drawing, but they have some unreasonable places and functional conflict, therefore after discussing with Jake, I just modified its color and layout as designed, and buttons on toolbar is remained. These changes have impact on test cases you wrote, please pay attention on them.

Our implementation doesn't 100% follow this design, because we found some funcitonal conflicts when we really worked on this. So after some discussion, we only decided to modify the colors and layouts following the design, but the buttons and toolbar should remain as before.
It's seems you have to change your test steps. Sorry, I should have this clearified earlier.
