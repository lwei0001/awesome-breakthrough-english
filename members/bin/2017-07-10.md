I used the key *\<blockedSenders enabled="true" limit="100" /\>* from webtop-config.xml to determine whether to send request, but the value of limit on client side is different from my settings. Could you please check if there are other settings on back-end that has effect on it.

I found client side got "BlockSender" limit from the "getConfigAsJavaScriptString" method of servlet object "bootstrapService" during app's initialization phase, not user's login phase. I guess this is the root cause why "BlockSender" setting didn't work. Could you please check it on back-end.
