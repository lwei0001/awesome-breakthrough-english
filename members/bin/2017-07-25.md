This feature is to make it possible to show customer information inside RUI & TUI. And it could show information anywhere in the application, such as user login, or button is clicked, or feature is used.
It could show information several times, and could show checkbox “do not show again” for user to select.

Furthermore, information page introduced by the iframe could get the content about app from external URL e.g, l (Language), sn (Surname), ma(e-mail address), t(Session Token), etc.

Client creates "IntroductionManager" class to manage overlay logics for RUI & TUI. If any of the conditions like "Show until date", "Show n-times" or "Show until clicked" has been met, ovelay will not show any more after user login. 

Client adds "client.rui/tui.introductionWinInfo" key to save overlay info for each user in "id1-n-flag,id2-n-flag" format. (id1 as "UniqueID" of a overlay, n as n-times for this overlay, flag as user's selection of checkbox).

Customer should override "getExternalUrl" method of "IntroductionWin" class to make external page get more info about app.
