This issue likes to have a possibility to show customer information inside RUI & TUI, could show information anywhere in the application, such as login, or button is clicked, or feature is used,
could show information several times, and could show checkbox “do not show again” for user's selection.

Furthermore, information page introduced by the iframe could get the content about app from external URL e.g, l (Language), sn (Surname), ma(e-mail address), t(Session Token), etc.

Client creates "IntroductionManager" class to manage overlay logic for RUI & TUI. If any one of "Show until date", "Show n-times" and "Show until clicked" meet, ovelay will not show after login. 

Client adds "client.rui/tui.introductionWinInfo" key to save overlay info for each user in "id1-n-flag,id2-n-flag" format. (id1 as "UniqueID" of a overlay, n as n-times for this overlay, flag as user's selection of checkbox).

Customer could override "getExternalUrl" method of "IntroductionWin" class to make external page get more info about app.
