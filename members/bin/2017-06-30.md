Hi Shaun,

This issue needs the "preview" field from Webtop XML API "msgheaderfetch" on client. RUI and TUI used Webtop XML API ("msgheaderlist", "msgheaderfetch" and "msgfetch") for Mail on client, it's hard to be replaced by JSON API in a short time, but Webtop only provides JSON API "getSummary" to support "preview" field. Therefore, please add "preview" field for "msgheaderfetch" XML API.

Furthermore, if any changes about PERIDOT-11097 on Webtop, please support XML API, the same reason as above.

Thanks
Bin.
