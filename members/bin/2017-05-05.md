# Original

The problem with contact sort can not to be reproduced every time. After several tests, I found that it would be reproduced only for some accounts under the UX server environment. Its steps are as follows:
1. Login RUI using u12@openwave.com/p, Add more than 300 contact data, then click "LastName" item on Sort picker.
2. After the contacts is loaded, drag down the scroll bar of Contact List, its alphabetical sequence will be disorder.

In my process of debugging code, I discovered the cause of its is the contact cache is not cleaned up in time, so the call removeAll method was added when sort contact, and the quickSearch method in ContactsToolbar was alse changed.

Followed the above steps to test again after fixed, verified that contact sort worked as expected. This improving may affect the contact search function, will not have an impact upon Config Changes, API changes and UI Compatibility.

# Rewrite by Hai

From above reproduce steps, I think major concern of this ticket is regarding contact sorting. The issue can’t always reproduce and after multiple times testing, I found it can only happen on certain account of Mx backend with following steps:

1. Login RUI with u12@openwave.com/p, add more than 300 contacts, select “Last Name” item on “Sort by” picker;
2. After the contacts are loaded, drag down the scroll bar of Contact List, it’s disorder without alphabetical.

After some investigation, I discovered/found the root cause of the issue is the contact cache did not clean up in time. To fix this issue, I added a function call of removeAll when sorting. And quickSearch method in ContactsToolbar class was changed as well.
I suggest when you verify this fix, you’d pay attention on contact search function.
This change has no impact on Config Changes, API changes and UI compatibility.
[Dev test case]
I run a test follow above steps and confirmed the issue was disappear and sorting function works well now.
