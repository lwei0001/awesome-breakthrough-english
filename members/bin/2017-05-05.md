The problem with contact sort can not to be reproduced every time. After several tests, I found that it would be reproduced only for some accounts under the UX server environment. Its steps are as follows:
1. Login RUI using u12@openwave.com/p, Add more than 300 contact data, then click "LastName" item on Sort picker.
2. After the contacts is loaded, drag down the scroll bar of Contact List, its alphabetical sequence will be disorder.

In my process of debugging code, I discovered the cause of its is the contact cache is not cleaned up in time, so the call removeAll method was added when sort contact, and the quickSearch method in ContactsToolbar was alse changed.

Followed the above steps to test again after fixed, verified that contact sort worked as expected. This improving may affect the contact search function, will not have an impact upon Config Changes, API changes and UI Compatibility.
