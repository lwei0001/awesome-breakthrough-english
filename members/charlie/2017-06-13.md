Hi Shimura-san,

The slow-speed of network bring this problem.

User click `Add` button, there will be create a new folder under current folder, and the new folder name is editing. After edited the folder name, the new folder is display on successful. However the web-server is creating this folder at the moment, if fail to create new folder, will return the failure information, then delete the new folder on display.

If user creates a folder under the newly created folder before get the failure information, will reproduce this issue.

If user creates a folder under the newly created folder, and Repeat this operation, maybe reproduce this issue.

These are in the slow speeds of the promise.
