AUI test procedure: 
* Login to AUI, go to Auto-reply.
* Edit something, tab to other page such as Auto-forward.
* A save confirm window pops up, tap 'Yes' button.
* Go back to main list, the screen reader reads "Saved successfully" at first, then reads "Automatically forward all incoming email to other email addresses. To specify several, separate each one with a comma. text".

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* After deleting one sender, the screen reader will move to and read the next focus randomly (different devices have different result, could be "add" button or "refresh" button). So it will read "add button" or "refreash button", then read "deleted successfully".
* Now, our solution is: After user delete a sender, let the screen reader focus on the delete button, so the screen reader will read "delete button" first, and then read "deleted successfully".
