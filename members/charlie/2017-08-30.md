Hi Deirdre,

I am sorry that the configuration is not very exhaustive.
In fact, there is a file used to record configuration information (refer to client-config.js).
In client-config.js, we could find all config properties and annotation, the annotation is (WTF???). For example, open client-config.js, there is a key  `ui.rui.layout.calendarContainer.headerHeight`, you could find the value of it around line 2474, and the annotation of it around line 2019. 
If you had any questions, please left comments in the ticket and assign back to me.
