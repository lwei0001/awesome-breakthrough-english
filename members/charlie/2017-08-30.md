Hi Deirdre,

I am sorry for that the configuration is not very detailed.
In fact, there is  a file  used to record configuration information(refer to client-config.js).
In client-config.js, we could find all config properties and  annotation, the annotation is .  For example, open client-config.js , there is a key  `ui.rui.layout.calendarContainer.headerHeight`, you could find the value of it in line 2474, and the annotation of it in line 2019. 
If you have any questions, please leave comments in the ticket and assign back to me.
