Hi Shimura-san,

The terrible network brought this problem.

After user clicks `Add` button, a new folder (as f1) was created under the current folder (as f2) with folder name is editing. After it is done editing, a temporary folder shown on the folder tree, but it doesn't mean the `f1` was created successful. if get unsuccessful response, could remove the `f1` on the folder tree.

There are 2 scenarios could bring this issue:

1. When user creates a folder under `f1` before get the failure information.

2. When user creates a folder (as f3) under `f1`, then creates a folder under `f3`, and Repeat this operation.

Hi Shimura-san,

The slow-speed of network bring this problem.

User click `Add` button, there will be create a new folder under current folder, and the new folder name is editing. After edited the folder name, the new folder is display on successful. However the web-server is creating this folder at the moment, if fail to create new folder, will return the failure information, then delete the new folder on display.

If user creates a folder under the newly created folder before get the failure information, will reproduce this issue.

If user creates a folder under the newly created folder, and Repeat this operation, maybe reproduce this issue.

These are in the slow speeds of the promise.
