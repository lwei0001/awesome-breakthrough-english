Hi Matthieu Lachance,If a user has 2000 contacts or more, it will only load 300 contacts when login in. When add a contact whose first name begins with 'Z', there is no way to know the right order of the created contact in all contacts (2000 contacts). And it is unreasonable and difficult to load 2000 contacts to get the right order of the created contact. In summary, I think this issue could not resolve now. Thanks.(peridot-11420)

Hi Mark Green,
About the suggestion from Jeanne, webtop should tell client that the calendar has been removed in response. Now the response only returns 'sdk.common.error.internalError', please refer to Bin's coment.(mercury-1180)

Hi Thunder Liu,
'message.folder.list' response return 'INBOX' as inbox folder path, but 'message.attachmentView.search' response return 'inbox'. This is inconsistent and the issue occurs. Please have a check. Thanks.(METHANE-264)
