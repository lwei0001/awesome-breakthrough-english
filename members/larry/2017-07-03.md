Hi, Rohit
 
I have a question about storage.account.list API. The response of the API between Etisalat environment and the current environment is different.
 
Etisalat:
 
id:"ba40a12e-7ff7-480c-8a88-0a09615794b8"
name:"SiggisPrivatePlanetAccount"
 
properties:{transitionPolicy: "single", canSave: "true", canBrowse: "true", canCreateDirectory: "true",…}
canBrowse:"true"
canCreateDirectory:"true"
canSave:"true"
defaultUploadFolder:"attachments"
endpoint:"http://p2w.pripla.com"
maxFileSize:"20000000"
transitionPolicy:"single"
userName:"testUser2"
type:"PrivatePlanet"
 
 
Current:
 
id:"4417238e-fa28-423e-afdd-116d33466736"
name:"SynchronossPersonalCloudAccount"
 
properties:{userName: "520aab0bef1146c2bacbacdf032ce378", applicationId: "ea591803-3e7c-4c42-a91a-55f5eb7612d8",…}
applicationId:"ea591803-3e7c-4c42-a91a-55f5eb7612d8"
refreshToken:"ubx0msV25v091p1CUYAfdGTV3DW7Gjs6"
userName:"520aab0bef1146c2bacbacdf032ce378"
type:"personalcloud"
 
‘canBrowse’ and ‘canSave’ and other properties do not exist in current environment.Does server delete them designedly? In client code, these properties help judge users if it can upload files or create folders.
 
Thanks,
Larry 


Hi Shaun, Rohit,

‘canBrowse’, ‘canCreateDirectory’, ‘canSave’ return default values. I think this is a good idea.

transitionPolicy – In fact that I don’t know exactly what this is for.The client code about cloud are not developed by our team.

But I can provide something I know about this property.

‘transionPolicy’ has three possible values, none, all, single. In Etisalat environment, the property of cloud is ‘single’,and hugemail’s is ‘all’. Maybe it has some relationship with hugemail.

In my test, it seems that it may not affect cloud functionalities event if it doesn’t exist. I suggest we can ignore it now.

Thanks,
Larry
