In fact, this is a regression of chrome (v53.0). Now the issue can not reproduce in 54.0 version and 55.0 version, so resolve it. Thanks.(peridot-10056)
hi Sean Smith
talk with QA, there are several different errors when add alias:
case 1
when test. login to testuser1@test.qa, after creating serval alias emails, contains testUser1@test.qa, testuSer1@test.qa, Testuser1@test.qa, when create tEstuser1@test.qa as alias email,it will response error.
case 2
when add a alias emails which is exist in other users' alias list,it will response error
my questions:
1. if the alias is as same as user email with case-insensitive , how many alias user can create? it seems indefinite.
2. how many errors in total? please tell me which property I can use to judge different error. client need the property to alert different warning message.
thanks 
larry
