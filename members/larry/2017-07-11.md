Hi, Rohit

I have two questions about cloud, and maybe you can help me . Thanks a lot.

Q1:

I replace webtop-personal-cloud-1.0.2.jar with webtop-personal-cloud-1.0.1.jar and restart tomcat. But it restarts unsuccessfully. Attachment named webtop.log is the webtop log.  Could you have a look and tell me the failure reason? Thanks.

Q2:

About storage.authentication.associate API, if ‘redirectUri’ is ‘http://localhost:8080/kiwi/index-rui-dev.jsp#app/settings’, webtop will return an error. Please refer to attachment named error.png. But if ‘redirectUri’ is ‘http://localhost:8080/kiwi/index-rui-dev.jspapp/settings’ (less than the former a ‘#’), the cloud can be associated successfully. I think the ‘#’ maybe affect webtop. Could you  explain what is the meaning of the error?  Thanks.

Thanks,
Larry
