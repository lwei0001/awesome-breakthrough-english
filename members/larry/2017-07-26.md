Hi Rohit,

I have some questions about cloud to confirm with you. Thanks.

Q1:

In Etisalat, if upload a file exceeded a certain value ( for example 5M ), the file will be uploaded to cloud and displays as a link. Is this feature supported by current cloud server?

Q2:

What is the max size of single file attached ? Is it limited?

Q3:

After removing cloud account and adding cloud account again, it will not jump to personal cloud login page, but associate with the previous personal account automatically. QA thinks it may be unreasonable. Could you explain it?

Thanks,
Larry
