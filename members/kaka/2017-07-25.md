There are a bad news and a good news.

The bad news is that there is no cross-version solution. This feature is only native support by IE9+.

Although we can implement this feature by JavaScript code, but the efficiency is too low, because of we must listen every input of the user.

The good news is this feature can be disabled on IE.

If we want to keep each browser has the same feature, we can consider to disable this feature for IE. It only needs one line code: 
"document.execCommand("AutoUrlDetect", false, false);"
