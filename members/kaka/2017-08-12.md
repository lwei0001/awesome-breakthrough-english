Hi Meiwen,

I think this ticket is not a bug.

Emoji is essentially the Unicode, but we don't convert Unicode to image at folder name. So the rendering of emoji depends on the browser. 

If we convert emoji Unicode to image. We have to face another problem. We use the emoji standard from Twitter, it's different from Apple's standards, so some emoji will be displayed differently.

If you want to support more emoji, we have to compare Android and iOS and other popular standards, and then list all the Unicode characters of emoji which we need to support.

We found the behavior of this ticket is same as Yahoo mail. Please refer to attachment "yahoo.png".

Thanks
Kaka
