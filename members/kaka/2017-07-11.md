Hi Team,

Please keep the consistency of the pop-up window and message boxes.

### Part 1.
Some pop-up windows have a "Cancel" button. So I have added a new config item "WebtopConfig.ui.rui.enableCancelButtonOnPopupWindow" in "client-config.js" to toggle the display and hide of the "Cancel" button.

This change will affect the following items: 
- Mail
    1. Add folder
- Contact
    1. Import contacts
    1. Export contacts
- Calendar
    1. Add calendar
    1. Exit calendar
    1. Subscribe calendar
    1. Share calendar
    1. Import calendar
    1. Export calendar
- Settings
    1. Mail -> Account -> Add/Edit account
    1. Mail -> Signature -> Add/Edit signature
    1. Mail -> Rules -> Add/Edit message filter

### Part 2.
Message box is used to confirm user operation, e.g. when the user to make a dangerous operation, this window will pop up to ask the user whether to confirm.

There are some message box without "X" button, I will add "X" button for these message boxes.

This change will affect the following items: 
- Change some settings and leave settings without save.
- Delete signature
- Delete mail
- Delete account


Looking forward to your insight.

Thanks
