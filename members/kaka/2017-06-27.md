1. Enable KIWI: porting corresponding code from OTOSAN to Kiwi to enable MCM feature in KIWI.
    - Add css and icon for KIWI 
    - Modify some component of MCM to adapt KIWI (Because some components have changed the layout, such as navigation bar)
    - Modify some code on KIWI, such as index-rui.jsp

Vikram:

Am not aware of the KIWI framework and UI. But if you all face any issues with KIWI UI integration with MCM let me know and I can help debug that issue and get it addressed.
 
Kaka:

Thank you very much for your help, ***but we also need your help.***  
Thanks, and we do need your help :)
Since UI is different between KIWI and OTOSAN, now all of icons can not be displayed and the switch online status button looks very strange in the main navigation bar.

2. Production
    - Bundle MCM source code
    - Modify build script for ant

Vikram:

This I believe is again for KIWI? So the same above answer applies.
 
Kaka:

This is not only for KIWI, but also for OTOSAN. Actually this is the product performance issues.

Our production version build should bundle source code files to reduce network requests to shorten loading time for user.
But MCM didn't bundle the source code files, and there are 24 script requests which is quite time consuming.

Our source codes are bundled to app.js except locale file and config file to reduce script request times.

I suggest using r.js to bundle AMD module, grab a look at https://github.com/requirejs/r.js.
