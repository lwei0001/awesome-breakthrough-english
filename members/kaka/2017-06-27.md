# Original

1. Enable Kiwi: porting corresponding code from OTOSAN to Kiwi to enable MCM feature in Kiwi.
    - Add css and icon for KIWI 
    - Modify some component of MCM to adapt KIWI (Because some components have changed the layout, such as navigation bar)
    - Modify some code on KIWI, such as index-rui.jsp

Vikram:

Am not aware of the KIWI framework and UI. But if you all face any issues with KIWI UI integration with MCM let me know and I can help debug that issue and get it addressed.
 
Kaka:

Thank you very much for your help, but we also need your help.  Because of the UI is different between KIWI and OTOSAN, now all of icons can not be displayed and the switch online status button shows very strange in the main navigation bar.

2. Production
    - Bundle MCM source code
    - Modify build script for ant

Vikram:

This I believe is again for KIWI? So the same above answer applies.
 
Kaka:

This is not only aimed at KIWI, it’s also for OTOSAN. This is the product performance issues.

We production version build should bundle source code files to reduce the network requests and with shorter loading time to user.
But the MCM didn’t bundle the source code files, there are 24 script requests and take a lot of time.

Our source codes are bundle to app.js except locale file and config file, to reduce script request times.

I suggest use r.js to bundle AMD module, please take a look at https://github.com/requirejs/r.js
