### The question came from PSO:

2.2 Hard-coded styles.

There are settings like "width: 100%" set in the JS that should be set in CSS (possibly).

For example Richui.view.contacts.ContactForm defines width: '100%' so if you then need some other width you cannot do it in CSS as easily as it should be.

### Below is my answer:

This is an ideal, we also hope all of style code in css files, but we are limited by ExtJS.

When some layout is used (e.g. fit / vbox / hbox), Ext is going to calculate the style data for layout.

We must set some style properties in JS to provide to Ext, otherwise some layout will appear style error.

Unfortunately, Ext's documentation is not perfect, it doesn't tell us which style is dependent on the calculations.

We will uphold a principle that keep style code in the CSS file as far as possible.


# Refactored

Well, this is a compromise. We certainly hoped all the style code coming from css files, but that's not gonna work with ExtJS.

ExtJS needs to calculate the style data if some kind of layout is used (e.g. fit/vbox/hbox). Thus we must set some styles and feed them to ExtJS, otherwise the layout will crash.

Unfortunately, the document from ExtJS is not clear and we cannot tell which style is dependent on the calculations.

So, there is really nothing much we can do about 'hard-coded styles' but we'll try our best to separate CSS from JS in other scenarios.
