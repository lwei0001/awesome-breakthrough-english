Need to confirm if the feature is like phone section which can add multi home-phone number.

If support, I think webtop needs to do some work about data structure.

An address contains street, city, state, zip and country information.

The format of request to create contact is as following:

contacts.createContact {
	"contact" : {
		...
		"fields" : [
                              ...
                              {
				"value" : "home_street",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "street"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_city",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "city"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_state",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "state"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_zip",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "zip"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_country",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "country"
			}
		]
	}
}

Every data node is independent about address structure above.

Whether the node is home address or work address depending on type such as 'lzAddress_home'. 

If we support multi home-address, client could not know which home-address street/city/... is belong to. 


For example: 

Add two home addresses.

In the first home address, set 'home_street1, home_city1, home_state1, home_zip1, home_country1' to relevant input.

In the second home address, set 'home_street2, home_city2, home_state2, home_zip2, home_country2' to relevant input.

The format of request will be as following:

contacts.createContact {
	"contact" : {
		"@type" : "Contact",
		...
		"fields" : [
                              ...
                              {
				"value" : "home_street1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "street"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_street2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "street"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_city1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "city"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_city2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "city"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_state1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "state"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_state2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "state"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_zip1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "zip"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_zip2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "zip"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_country1",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "country"
			}, {
				"value" : "home_country2",
				"primary" : false,
				"type" : "lzAddress_home",
				"label" : "country"
			}
		]
	}
}

There are two countries above.

One is 'home_country1' and the other is 'home_country2'.

But the types in these two countries are both 'lzAddress_home'. Client cannot know each country belongs to which home-address.

So if we support multi home-address or work-address, help from webtop is important.
