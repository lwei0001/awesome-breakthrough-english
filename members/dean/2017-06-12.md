Hi Matthieu,

There are two tickets need you to confirm (PERIDOT-7379 and PERIDOT-7998).

1, PERIDOT-7379  is about showing previous/next month event list in event list view of Calendar.
In order to be consistent with month/week/day view mode, the implementation method is:
swipe left to show event list in next month, swipe right to show event list in previous. 
Do you have some advice about this behavior?

2,  PERIDOT-7998 is about auto-scrolls to event list in date user tap in month/week view. 
There are many comments in SERVICES-3728, no final decision in it. 
I just did the feature auto-scrolls to event list in date user tap. 
Could you check it that is there any other features need to do?

Both the two tickets i had checked in codes, you can visit http://rwc-hinoki06:8080/kiwi-master/index-tui.jsp#app/calendar to look at it. 
Hope you can give some advice. 
Thank you.
