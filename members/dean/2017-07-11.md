The issue can be reproduced with the following steps:
  1. Open chrome browser, visit http://rwc-hinoki06.owmessaging.com:9090/koala/index-rui.jsp.
  2. Open the DevTools of browser, click 'Network Conditions'.
  3. Copy 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; Touch; rv:11.0) like Gecko' to user agent.
  4. Execute 'BrowserDetect.checkDesktop()' command in DevTools' console panel.

PS: I have called out the steps in the attached screenshot.

Result: "notsupport-rui.jsp" displays.

Compared 'ckdevice.js' in http://rwc-hinoki06.owmessaging.com:9090/koala/index-rui.jsp with 'ckdevice.js' in http://rwc-hinoki06.owmessaging.com:8080/kiwi-develop-201-rel/index-rui.jsp, I found two files are different and the result in Kiwi is "index-rui.jsp". Would you please have a look at it?
