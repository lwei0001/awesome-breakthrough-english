Fixed in PERIDOT-8644 and as i commented in PERIDOT-8644:
I think this is not a regression, it is reproduced on Tablet.
It was only fixed on Phone in PERIDOT-5248 which status is still resolved, and no QA retested it.
Meiwen Hwang what's your mean about 'it seems to be broken'?

The message list uses infinite scroll technology.
There does not cache Dom element in TUI.
The number of message elements won't increase by scrolling down, maybe about 28 message elements.
For user experience, it only caches the message data from server.
It has not serious performance even if there are 10 thousands messages which size is less than 10 M .
