Fixed in PERIDOT-8644 and as I commented there:

I think this is not a regression, it is reproduced on Tablet.

It was only fixed on Phone in PERIDOT-5248 of which the status is still resolved, and no QA retested it.

Meiwen Hwang what do you mean about 'it seems to be broken'?

The message list uses infinite scrolling technology.

It doesn't cache Dom element in TUI.

The number of message elements won't increase by scrolling down. And maybe just create about 28 message elements is enough.

For better user experience, it only caches the message data from server.

It has not serious performance problem even if there are 10 thousands messages with size less than 10 M .
