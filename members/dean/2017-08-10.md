There is a 'globalMaskDelay' key in client-config.

The feature of the key is to let user see the mask as few as possible.

If it is set to 0, the loading spinner will appear right now when switching to other month.

If the CPU is busy, the behavior will be affected.

Please set 'globalMaskDelay' to 0, then check whether there is a spinner or not.

https://bitbucket.org/openwave/peridot/commits/2bff18705f2ca4494659495c2126ed1672098e64.

But the two keys were not removed. Now the two keys are useless.
