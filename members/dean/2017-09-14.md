A workarounds is that using Worker (https://www.w3.org/TR/workers/) technology to load contact firstly.
It cannot block performance of client. Then find the contact by email in loaded contacts and decide whether to load photo based on the value of 'lzPhoto' in the found contact.

But there are some questions need to confirm.

Question 1:
How many contacts need to load, a number of contacts or all contacts?

Loading all contacts: If there are too many contacts in an account, does it affect the performance of Webtop?

Loading a number of contacts: If there does not find the contact in the loaded contacts by email. Does client need to continue to load contact? 

Question 2:

Tested in Otosan environment there is no 'lzPhoto' field in response, does client need to set a config to open or close the feature?
