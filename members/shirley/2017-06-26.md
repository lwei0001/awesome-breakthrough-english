Hi,

Considering the width of the mobile device, When user slides the message to the left in the maillist, the interface should be allowed user to deal with email in a more convenient and efficient way. So we only provide a quick list (not include 'reply All') on the maillist. And detailed list (include 'reply All') was also provided  in the mail detail. So this is 'work as design'.

Thanks
Shirley.

The mobile of 'Keron' is '(17) 234/789 - 09', it contains 3 spaces, and those spaces lead to the wrong search result of webtop.
