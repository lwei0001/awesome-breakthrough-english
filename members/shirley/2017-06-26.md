1.Hi,
Considering the width of the mobile device, When user slides the message to the left, the interface should be allowed user to deal with email in a more convenient and efficient way. So we only provide a quick list (not include 'reply All') on the maillist. But detailed list (include 'reply All') was provided  in the mail detail.So this is 'work as design'.

The mobile of 'Keron' is '(17) 234/789 - 09', it contains 3 spaces, and those spaces lead to the wrong search result of webtop.
