Hi,

Considering the width of the mobile device, When user slides the message to the left in the maillist, the interface should be allowed to deal with email in a more convenient and efficient way. So we only provide a quick list (not include 'reply All') on the maillist. And detailed list (include 'reply All') was provided  in the mail detail. So this is 'work as design'.

Thanks

Shirley.

The mobile of 'Keron' is '(17) 234/789 - 09', it contains 3 spaces, and those spaces lead to the wrong search result of webtop.

Manager and I think we should keep the format with the initial mail when we do 'reply' or 'replyAll'. But, when we do 'forward' (include 'forwardAsAttach' and 'forwardInline'), we should use the default format. And what did I changed are based on this viewpoint.
