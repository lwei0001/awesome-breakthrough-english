Hi Sante Paciello,

The code which lead to this issue is 'record.get(‘type’) == "group"'. I’m not fully understand what did you mean "Contact picker doesn’t work for groups". Can you give me a specific test case for this issue?


Thanks & Regards,
Shirley




The version of test url is 2.2.008, but the latest version 2.2.021 is works well, this phenomenon is not exist. So this issue should be closed.


The Back-end set some config to allow the user to create many groups with the same name. So this is actually “work as expected”.




Hi Marcelo,

Thanks & Regards,
