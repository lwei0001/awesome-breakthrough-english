According to the code in AbstractConfig.js, the role "canBeSaved" is used for enabling and disabling "Save" and "Cancel" button (If the page have those buttons). If the value of form was dirty, it would pop up the warning message no matter what value ‘canBeSaved’ was.

Hi Sante Paciello,

The code which lead to this issue is 'record.get(‘type’) == "group"'. I’m not fully understand your comment "Contact picker doesn’t work for groups". Can you give me a specific use case for this issue?

Thanks & Regards,

Shirley


The version of test url is 2.2.008, but the latest version 2.2.021 and the situation you mentioned doesn't exist. So this issue should be closed.

The back-end has some rules to allow the user to create many groups with the same name. So this is actually “work as expected”.


Hi Marcelo,
 
I’m not fully understand your comment 'The "Show image" button for the image attachments fails in RichUI 2.2'. Would you please give a detail explanation?

Thanks & Regards,

Shirley
