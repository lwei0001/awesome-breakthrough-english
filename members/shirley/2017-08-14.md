The option of 'conversation view' will not be saved. If user choose it in main account, switch to external account, this option will show 
the default state (unselected) . So if user want to show the mail list with 'conversation view' in external account, he/she has to choose
again. There are two reasons for this behavior:

1.External account dosenâ€™t support 'conversation view'.

2.Keep consistent with 'Attachment view'.

So this is actually working as expected.
