The option of ‘conversion view’ will not be saved. If user choose it  in main account, switch  to extenal account, this option will show 
the default state (unselected). So if user want to show the mail list with ‘conversion view’ in extenal account, he/she has to choose
again. There are two reasons for this behavior :

1.External account dosen’t support ‘conversion view’.

2.Keep consistent with ‘Attachemnt view’.

So this is actually working as expected.
