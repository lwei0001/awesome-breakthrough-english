Firstly, different search result is reasonable, search result by phone include search result by mobile, but the latter doesn't include the former.
Besides, this issue has been fixed in PERIDOT-11061, the checkbox of 'Mobile' is redundant, it will dispear in the next version(109).

First,I have updated the Spanish into the latest version, it will be available in next build.
Second, do not remove the key 'REMOVE_SHARED_CALENDAR' which is used in Tui, maybe someone forgot to add in English file,I have done it. 
Thanks for your help.
