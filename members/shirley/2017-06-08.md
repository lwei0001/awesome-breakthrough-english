Firstly, it is reasonable that the search results are different. The result of searching by phone will include the result of mobile's, but things are not the same on the contrary.
Besides, this issue has been fixed in PERIDOT-11061. The checkbox of 'Mobile' is redundant and will be removed in the next version.

First, I have merged Spanish into the latest version, it will be available in the next build.
Second, do not remove key 'REMOVE_SHARED_CALENDAR'. It is used in TUI and I have added to the English locale file.

Thanks for your help.

According to the code in AbstractConfig.js, the key 'canBeSaved' is used to control the state of 'save' and 'cancel' button (if the page has those buttons). If the form value is considered dirty, there will be pop ups with warning message no matter whether the 'canBeSaved' is true or false.
