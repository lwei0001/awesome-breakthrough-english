Q: What are the corresponding keys of these two configurations value in server? Which one should I use to access those keys? 'mailPreference' or 'generalPreference'?

Added a configuration setting for 'whitelisting', when it 'enable', there will be a another setting used in the safe sender tab,
 turn it to 'enable', only the messages from the user 'whitelist PAB'  will shown in the inbox, other messages will go to the spam folder.

Added three options 'Whitelist sender', 'Block domain' and 'Block sender and mark as spam' in the drop down menu. Reordered the list, grouped all the options and separated them with two separators.
