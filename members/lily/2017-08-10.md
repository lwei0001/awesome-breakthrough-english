I think it's possible to specify a category as its destination folder when reporting a message.

When user mark a message (from search result/Spam folder) as not spam, the destination folder is Inbox.

For example:

user opens Spam folder and clicks 'Mark as not spam' menu, the client will send a request as the following.

`{"method":"mail.message.report","params":{"accountId":"","folderPath":"Junk","selection":{"uids":["1025"]},"type":"notJunk","destFolderPath":"INBOX"},"id":"Junk"}`

If category view is enabled, does client need to invalidate virtual folder id of Inbox and set category flag and vade flag for the message to be marked as not spam?

When user moves a message into/out Spam folder, client currently uses 'mail.message.searchReport' API to mark messages as spam/unspam .
If category view is enabled, should client use 'mail.category.message.move' or 'mail.message.searchReport' for the case ?

Answers to the two quesitons:

**Could the client automatically re-run the search and move if the source vfolder id is invalid?**
 
The client can automatically re-run the search but can't move again.
Because the message moved not be in the first page and client can't make sure the message info is in new search result.

**What does the client currently do if the user moves a message from a set of search results to a different IMAP folder?**

The client just pops up a error message and doesn't handle it further.
Seems It's a remaining issue.

Yes, it's very useful for the client.

But I'm still have some questions about the new API.

1 If both 'sourceVirtualFolderId' and 'destVirtualFolderId' were invalid, would the command work?

2 Will the sequence of APIs in a batch request affect request result? 

  For example:

If user ran a search and then selected four messages to move into 'social' category folder. 

Two messages existed in 'SentMail' IMAP folder, two messages existed in inbox folder.

I assume the batch request looks like the following.

 `mail.category.message.move { "sourceVirtualFolderId": "1", "virtualSelection": [ { "uid": 1081, "folderPath": "INBOX" } ], "set": [ "V_SOCIAL", "social" ], "unset": [ "V_INBOX", "clean"], "destVirtualFolderId":  "2" }

 mail.category.message.move { "sourceFolderPath": "SentMail", "selection": { "uids": [ 1097 ] }, "set": [ "V_SOCIAL", "social" ], "unset": [ .... ], "destVirtualFolderId": "2" }`

If reversing the request order, inbox cache may be cleared, would it affect the next command?

3 I don't understand the statement (The 'sourceVirtualFolderId' represents the cache - if webtop invalidates it, then it returns the id on its response.), could you please explain it more detail, such as what 'id' here means?
