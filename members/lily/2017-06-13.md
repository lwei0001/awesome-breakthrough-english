## The first mail
I heard from Jake that you did some work in BT Accessbility.
Meiwen said that BT will automaticlly redirect to AccessUI if screen reader has been detected.
And Telstar hopes that AccessUI2.0 uses the same way to redirect to AccessUI.
But in http://bjwiki.bei.cp.net/index.php/BT_AccessUI_Knowledge_Summary there is a different description.
The steps to access Accessibility UI on BT hidden production are currently as follows:
access RUI with https://btmail.bt.com
After login to the SSO, open RUI Email page and then switch to AUI as follows:
Press Ctrl+Alt+S, then a pop up 'Simple view(Accessible)' shows up, and then press Enter key or mouse clicks on the menu to bring you to AUI. "

Do you know which mechanism BT is using now?

## The second mail
In AccessUI 2.0 we also want to use quick key to redirect to AccessUI.
But we run into a problem how to tell user what  the quick key is.
Do you know how BT notice user that he should press Ctrl+Alt+S key to redirect to  AccessUI?
