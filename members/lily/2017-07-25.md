Shaun,

Will the upcoming Octane build include any update about category views?

If yes,  could you please tell me which API is ready?

##
Client needs to show message total count and unread count for every folder.

If category view is enabled, client will display virtual folders 'Inbox', 'Social' and 'Commercial'.

For getting real folders and message count of virtual folders, client has to send three 'simpleSearchByFlag' requests and one 'mail.folder.list' request in loading mail folder phase.

I'm not sure if this will be a performance issue.

##
If I use 'multiFlag' to generate test data, Is it right to set flag 'V_INBOX' for virtual 'Inbox' folder, 'V_SOCIAL' for 'Social' folder and 'V_CLUTTER' for 'Clutter' folder?
 
And I have some questions about 'simpleFlagSearch' API.
 
I assume the request to loading a category folder looks like the following.
 
`mail.message.simpleFlagSearch{"folderPaths":["INBOX"], "sort":{"field":"natural","direction":"descending"}, setFlags: ['V_INBOX'], "uidsOnly":true, persist: true, count: 25}`
 
1. Under what situation should client set multiple values into 'folderPaths' field?
 
2. Under what situation should client use 'unsetFlags'?
 
Incidentally, It took about 59290ms to get 'simpleFlagSearch' response (mail.message.simpleFlagSearch{"folderPaths":["INBOX"], "sort":{"field":"natural","direction":"descending"}, setFlags: ['V_INBOX'], "uidsOnly":true, persist: true, count: 25})

In the same test environment It's about 162.19ms to get 'mail.message.list' response.

I'm not sure if It's a performance issue.
