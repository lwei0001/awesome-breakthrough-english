## The detached preview feature description for QA testing

# Original
The key to implementing the feature is to maintain the consistency of the parent and child window data.
There are too many operations easily affecting child window,
and it's too complicated and difficult to update every child window as the data in main window changes.
So currently supporting data synchronization from child window to parent window, but not supporting on the contrary.

There are many codes newly added to process data synchronization from child window to main window.
If user makes any action in detached preview window, such as move, delete, mark as spam, flag, block sender etc.,
the child window will send an event notification main window.
The main window receives the event and then tries to find the same mail in message list to modify per the event info.
The corresponding event ('mailmovesuccess', 'maildeletesuccess', etc.) is fired to keep the data consistent in main window.
The mail cache of related folder is deleted and the message list may be refreshed for some special cases specially in conversation view mode.
The change mainly affects mail data cache, detached compose, mail preview and delete, mark as spam/ mark as not spam, block sender and read/unread, etc. operation or features.
Please pay special attention to data consistency when making operation on a message displayed in detached window.
